<h1>Homework 2</h1>
<p>For this week’s reading I am choosing to write about orthogonality in coding and teamwork.
  This term itself was a new word for me when I read this chapter. However, the idea is something I have heard of before. 
  It is interesting to me that this entire section revolves around the idea of not overlapping projects and letting people do their own things. 
  I have always heard the opposite to that growing up. My entire life I have been surrounded with and had the idea of teamwork and doing everything 
  together pounded into my head. While I know the idea of orthogonality doesn’t say that you should have teamwork, 
  I love that there is a limit to how much teamwork there should be. </p>
  
  <p> I enjoy that using this idea it allows people to do their own thing and work on projects without
    having to constantly sit in meetings and talk through every thought and idea. To do this people, must work separately. 
    This much makes sense and was a little obvious when reading, but it is an important idea to keep track of. I love that 
    they related it to parallel lines. The lines will never intersect but are in the same plane. So, I directly see this as 
    two people on a team but are working on different parts of code and how what one person does should have no impact on another person’s work. Overall,
    it is good work ethic and good coding practice that I learned from the idea of orthogonality.
